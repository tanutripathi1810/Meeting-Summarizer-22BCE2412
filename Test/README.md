- üí∞ Cost-effective: ~$0.05 for 5-min meeting, ~$0.41 for 1-hour meeting

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key (2 minutes)

Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Sign up or log in
- Click "Create new secret key"
- Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

### 2. Run Setup Script (1 minute)

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This automatically:
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs all dependencies
- Creates necessary folders
- Sets up `.env` configuration file

### 3. Add Your API Key

Edit the `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
SPEECH_RECOGNITION_LANGUAGE=en
```

Replace `sk-your-actual-key-here` with your real API key!

### 4. Start the Application

```bash
./run.sh
```

Then open your browser to: **http://localhost:5000**

That's it! üéâ

### Example Output

**Summary**

Aayush presented enhancements to MongoDB, focusing on improved observability and rate limiting to address incidents like the April 26, 2025 outage. Aayush implemented granular Prometheus metrics, a custom usage analysis pipeline for extended data retention, an enhanced query profiler, and user-based rate limiting with an access gate and cost enforcers. The discussion centered on making MongoDB more transparent, predictable, and resilient.

**Details**

**MongoDB Enhancements Overview**
Aayush presented their work on enhancing MongoDB observability and implementing rate limiting, aiming to make MongoDB more transparent, predictable, and resilient. The motivation for this project stemmed from incidents like the April 26, 2025 outage of the dev app, which was caused by high CPU and network spikes due to a notification service with 45,000 unread notifications. They highlighted that such incidents have become more common (00:00:00).

**Challenges and Solutions**
Aayush explained that MongoDB, despite being heavily used, is difficult to debug and easy to overuse, with a lack of observability leading to delayed incident detection. To address this, they implemented granular Prometheus metrics and service collection at operation levels, allowing for plotting of latency, error rates, and throughput. They also developed a custom usage analysis pipeline that supports analysis for longer durations than MongoDB Atlas's 7-day limit (00:06:11).

**Suggested next steps**
- Test the rate limiting system in staging environment - Assigned to: Engineering team - Due: Next week
- Review the new Prometheus metrics dashboard - Assigned to: DevOps team - Due: Not specified
- Schedule follow-up meeting to discuss implementation - Assigned to: Aayush - Due: Within two weeks

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not found"
**Solution:**
- Create `.env` file in project root
- Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
- Get key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Restart the server

### "Port 5000 already in use" (macOS)
**Solution:**
- Disable AirPlay Receiver:
  - System Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí AirDrop & Handoff
  - Turn off "AirPlay Receiver"

### "Module not found" errors
**Solution:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "File too large" / "Audio file too large"
**Solution:**
- Whisper has 25MB limit per file
- Compress audio: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -b:a 64k output.mp3`
- Or split into smaller segments

### "Transcription failed"
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Check API key has credits/billing enabled
- Ensure audio file is not corrupted

---

## Security & Privacy

- **File uploads**: Type and size validated
- **Data transmission**: Sent to OpenAI API (encrypted in transit via HTTPS)
- **OpenAI policy**: Not used for training (as per API terms)
- **Local storage**: All results saved on your machine
- **API key**: Store securely in `.env` (never commit to git)
- **CORS**: Enabled for development (disable for production)

---

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection for API calls
- OpenAI API costs apply (see pricing above)
- 25MB file size limit (Whisper API constraint)
- No authentication (add if needed for production)
- Synchronous processing (async can be added for very long files)

## Production Deployment

### Considerations for Production

If deploying to production, consider adding:

1. **Authentication**: User login and API key management
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL instead of file-based storage
4. **Async Processing**: Celery/Redis for long audio files
5. **Error Monitoring**: Sentry or similar
6. **HTTPS/SSL**: Secure connections
7. **Environment Configs**: Separate dev/staging/prod settings
8. **Logging**: Comprehensive application logging
9. **Backup**: Regular data backups

### Environment Variables for Production

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-production-key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
SPEECH_RECOGNITION_LANGUAGE=en
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH=104857600
```
